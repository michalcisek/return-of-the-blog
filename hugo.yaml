    Title: Messy thoughts dressed up with data
    Content: |
      Welcome to my personal blog! ðŸ‘‹ 
      
      A few words about me: Professionally, I solve interesting problems using data, statistics, and technologies.
      
      - 

      From time to time, intriguing (and sometimes weird) ideas, thoughts, or curious questions pop into my head â€” and I like to explore them in my free time.

      - 

      This blog is where I share those explorations, hoping they might inspire something of your own â€” and maybe also help motivate me to finish them.
