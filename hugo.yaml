    Title: Messy thoughts dressed up with data
    Content: |
      Welcome to my personal blog! ðŸ‘‹ 
      
      Few words about me: Professionally I solve interesting problems using data, statistics and technologies.
      
      - 

      From time to time some intriguing thoughts or ideas come to my mind, that I try to explore in my free time. 

      - 

      Here I want to share them with you, hoping they might inspire you for something on your own (and also in hope to motivate myself to finish them).
