Welcome to my personal blog! 👋 

A few words about me: Professionally, I solve interesting problems using data, statistics, and technologies.

From time to time, intriguing (and sometimes weird) ideas, thoughts, or curious questions pop into my head — and I like to explore them in my free time.

This blog is where I share those explorations, hoping they might inspire something of your own — and maybe also help motivate me to finish them.
